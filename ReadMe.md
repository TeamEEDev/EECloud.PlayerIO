##EECloud.PlayerIO
[EECloud.PlayerIO](http://github.com/Yonom/EECloud.PlayerIO) is an unofficial open-sourced version of the [Player.IO](http://playerio.com/) client DLL written in [C#](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29). As C# is based on the [Microsoft .NET Framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework), you should have its latest version installed in order to use the assemblies built by this project flawlessly.
